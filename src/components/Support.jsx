        <p className="marge">
          Last week, I came out publicly about the need for VCs to step up and
          support founders. I did not expect the need for support to be so acute
          and so sudden following the collapse of SVB just 48 hours later… One
          of the many cliches in venture capital is that you should find
          companies with teams so talented that they will succeed in your
          ability to help them. So goes the axiom: the best investments are the
          ones that need your help the least. However, as time has progressed,
          it has become obvious to us that this axiom is false. Our observation
          is the best founders don’t have all the answers, they want support,
          and they ask the most questions – of themselves, their team, their
          advisors and their investors. The best founders draw on the most
          support along their path to building greatness. And if the
          relationship developed between a founding team and an investor is
          successful, there is always a place to add value. The irony in all of
          this is that if your VC’s peak aspiration is to invest in you but not
          be good enough for you, that is counterproductive to your mission.
          Conversely, does it really make sense to invest in a startup and then
          consciously or unconsciously limit the effort you would expend to
          support that investment? Unfortunately, the nature of founder support
          across the Aussie VC spectrum is diluting as portfolios expand, and
          engagement without a value-add becomes the standard model. Whilst the
          best companies in many portfolios receive the most ‘attention’, the
          experience of early founders is that of a big-promise, low-outcome
          soup of disorganisation, and misaligned expectations of what support
          is needed. It would be easy to dismiss this as a mere
          generalisation––it is obvious that all generalisations are
          flawed––however, the recent State of Australian Startup Funding report
          highlighted the problem. It is telling that a survey of more than 500
          VC-backed founders said that 62% of founders do not believe investors
          have delivered on non-capital value-add promises. Furthermore, 67% of
          women founders don’t feel supported by the ecosystem and 50% of men
          feel the same. The data is clear. This isn’t just a case of differing
          perspectives on what value-add looks like; it's an indication that the
          investor-founder promise of support is broken. Whilst nobody wants a
          VC as a shadow executive, and, equally, VCs should ideally be ‘hands
          off’, the emerging trend is one of investor disengagement, wooden and
          ineffective board participation, unmet promises post-investment, and a
          tendency for ‘tweets and term sheets’ as a solve-all for more
          demanding challenges.

        <h1 className="marge">Support doesn’t scale</h1>
        <p className="marge">
          VC ‘support’ can be encapsulated in a wide range. From zero or
          irregular engagement, community initiatives, regular 1:1 founder
          engagement, board participation, selective direct services, ‘full
          stack’ support provided by 100-person teams, and hands-on activities
          that cut a fine line between deep engagement to overbearing shadow
          executives. There isn’t a right model, but each end of this spectrum
          could justifiably be argued as the wrong model. Ideally, founder
          support should not be limited to funds with big balance sheets and big
          funds. Support should be fit for purpose, and start with a genuine
          intent to give founders multiple shots on goal as they build an
          enduring company. This can start at a small scale by simply asking
          your founders what they need and creating a system of external support
          to service these needs. Typically, however, a VC’s decision to provide
          support at scale across a portfolio comes down to the firm’s
          philosophy, the firm’s balance sheet and its willingness to trade team
          outcomes for portfolio outcomes. In this regard, too many VCs have
          argued that support should be limited to breakout companies because
          support doesn’t scale, and it's too costly. The result is often little
          engagement, periodic 1:1 engagement, or reliance on the power (and
          often confusion) of community to do the majority of the work. These
          can be constructive approaches, but if a VC struggles to find a middle
          ground or to innovate, too many opportunities to add value fall
          through the cracks. Just like a world-class engineer can 10x-100x the
          work of a good engineer, VC support can have similar dynamics. The
          value of drawing on the collective wisdom of truly experienced people
          around the table is clear, so long as the advice is credible, engaged
          and we would argue aligned to the outcome. We have seen too many
          all-care-no-responsibility participants around startups who are
          frankly damaging the founders' journeys and causing confusion. This
          also includes flippant and uninformed commentary from VCs prepared to
          offer low-conviction advice at the expense of company outcomes. Don't
          get me wrong, I know a lot of partners, principals and emerging
          investors who would eat glass for their founders and who are always
          there for support (as we saw this week with SVB), and I have seen
          extraordinary efforts play out that have saved companies. But there’s
          not enough evidence to be confident that this ecosystem is heading in
          the right direction. So what’s our answer?

        <h1 className="marge">Introducing the Folklore Support Stack</h1>
        <p className="marge">
          Folklore doesn’t want to be known for logo-squatting, or an
          all-care-no-responsibility name on a cap table. Our starting principle
          was that support should be available to all portfolio companies, and
          not just the upper echelon of performers in a VC’s portfolio. We
          listened to our founders and their teams and systematically iterated
          on different approaches over a number of years to achieve our current
          working model, which is a refined support stack that is suitable for
          our entire portfolio and complementary to the journey of every
          Folklore founder. We’re not proposing our Stack is the answer, and we
          have not built a support model to create jobs for ourselves or justify
          our existence. Moreover, our willingness to support our companies
          doesn’t mean we want to operate those companies, nor does it suggest
          we have all the answers for our founders. Rather, the Folklore Support
          Stack is a dedicated experience allowing our founders and their teams
          to run faster and more efficiently at their visions, giving them
          access to a toolkit, resources, programs and connections that matter –
          it is designed to scale from 1:1 to 1:1000s and to give our teams more
          shots on goal. We are constantly developing this Stack so that a year
          from now it will have materially improved.

          One of the benefits of having a high-conviction investment approach is
          that we’ve always been able to provide direct support to our portfolio
          through our team and an extensive advisor network. The Folklore team
          is known for always being available – in fact, it’s one of our
          fundamental values. Whether founders are looking for support with big
          hairy decisions, strategy, hiring and firing, shifting macro
          conditions, PR campaigns or subsequent fundraising, our team jumps in.
